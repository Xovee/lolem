# League of Legends E-Sports Manager Helper

This repo hosts a game helper of *League of Legends E-Sports Manager*. 

Main features:

- Intelligent Recruit Players
- Club Event
- Equipment Entry
- Card Obtaining Probability
- Medal

# Change Log

- Oct 15, 2022: add `medal` page, remove `gift` page since the game itself shows what gifts the players/employees favorate.
- Oct 15, 2022: optimize the hiring process of players, shows success probability. I think now it is much easier and clearer to use.
